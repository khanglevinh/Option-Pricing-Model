# Option Pricing Model with Python (Binomial Tree and Black - Scholes)  
In this project, I focused on option pricing using two models: the Binomial Tree and the Black-Scholes model. The underlying asset chosen for this analysis is AMD stock. I conducted a comparative study to demonstrate that the option price calculated using the Binomial Tree model approaches the Black-Scholes price as the number of steps 
N increases towards infinity. This exploration provides insights into the effectiveness of the Binomial Tree model in approximating the values predicted by the Black-Scholes model for option pricing.
