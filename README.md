# Option Pricing Model with Python (Binomial Tree and Black - Scholes)
**1. Introduction**  
In this project, I focused on option pricing using two models: the Binomial Tree and the Black-Scholes model. The underlying asset chosen for this analysis is AMD stock. I conducted a comparative study to demonstrate that the option price calculated using the Binomial Tree model approaches the Black-Scholes price as the number of steps

N increases towards infinity. This exploration provides insights into the effectiveness of the Binomial Tree model in approximating the values predicted by the Black-Scholes model for option pricing.  
**2. Implementation**  
First, I downloaded the AMD stock data from yfinance library, with start date = '2025 - 01 - 01'. Below is the AMD stock values over time:
